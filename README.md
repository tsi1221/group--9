3. Executive Summary

Fitihaber Ethiopia is a modern legal-tech platform designed to connect lawyers, witnesses, and guarantors in a secure and efficient online environment. The platform allows users to chat, schedule consultations, share legal documents, and manage payments all in one place.

    Legal documents are stored in encrypted cloud storage with strict access controls.

The microservices approach ensures scalability, fault isolation, and independent deployment for features like chat, payments, and file handling.
