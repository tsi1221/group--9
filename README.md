//// TITLE- Fitihaber Ethiopia





1. Project Name

Fitihaber Ethiopia



2. Sector / Industry

Legal Technology (LawTech) â€” specializing in digital lawyer-client collaboration, witness (tekesash) and guarantor (kesash) integration, online legal consultancy, and case management.


3. Executive Summary

Fitihaber Ethiopia is a modern legal-tech platform designed to connect lawyers, witnesses, and guarantors in a secure and efficient online environment. The platform allows users to chat, schedule consultations, share legal documents, and manage payments all in one place.

Built with a scalable microservices architecture, it leverages React with Vite for a fast, responsive frontend, Node.js with Express for a robust backend, and PostgreSQL for secure relational data management. The system also supports real-time features like video calls (WebRTC) and instant messaging (Socket.IO), ensuring a seamless experience for legal professionals and clients.



4. Problem Statement


In Ethiopia and many other regions, the legal process is often slow, paper-based, and difficult to coordinate. Lawyers, witnesses, and guarantors often face challenges in:

    Scheduling and communication

    Securely exchanging documents

    Tracking payments and agreements

    Coordinating for case timelines and legal proceedings

This leads to delays, miscommunication, and reduced trust in the legal process.



5. Solution

   

Fitihaber Ethiopia solves this by creating a centralized, secure, and user-friendly platform where:

    Lawyers can manage clients, schedule consultations, and handle payments.

    Witnesses (Tekesash) and Guarantors (Kesash) can securely participate in the legal process, verify agreements, and communicate directly with lawyers.

    All parties can use integrated chat, video calls, and calendars to stay on track.

    Legal documents are stored in encrypted cloud storage with strict access controls.

The microservices approach ensures scalability, fault isolation, and independent deployment for features like chat, payments, and file handling.



6. Objectives / Mission
   

    Digitalize the connection between lawyers, witnesses, and guarantors.

    Enhance trust through secure, verified communications.

    Speed up legal case processing with online scheduling and payments.

    Provide access to legal services for remote users.

    Ensure compliance with Ethiopian legal and data protection standards
    

7. Target Audience / Beneficiaries
